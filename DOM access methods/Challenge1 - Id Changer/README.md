## Adding JavaScript to a Wesbsite 

I have been trying to manipulate DOM using plane JavaScript through out this project <br />

## Concepts Learnt:

* Store the element to be manipulated in a variable
* apply the DOM method on this variable e.g innerHTML to change the content 

```
// h1 element 
var h1El = document.getElementById("id-name");
// Changing the content of innerHTML
h1El.innerHTML = "Martin Luther King";
```

Below are two pictures showing before and after adding JavaScript to our WebPage


### Before Adding JS

#### TIP : Comment the script tag to fail the JS from loading

### After Adding JS
